Project Description:

  This project is an attempt to visualize the vegetation areas from above space scene in
  satellite imagery to improve database design in monitoring vegetation land use change. 
  This is done by employing vegetation feature indices on a landscape classification of 
  vegetation areas in Seninel-2 satellite images. The methods are built upon a Python 
  programming workflow and are examined by designing a spatial database and SQL query 
  statements. By doing so, this project found a considerable decrease in total area of 
  green spaces in the area of study, and more general approved the analytical capabilities
  of spatial database design in land use change detection in urban regions.
