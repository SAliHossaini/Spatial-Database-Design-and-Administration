This project is an attempt to visualize the vegetation areas from above space scene in satellite imagery to improve database design in monitoring vegetation land use change. This is done by employing vegetation feature indices on a landscape classification of vegetation areas in Seninel-2 satellite images. The methods are built upon a Python programming workflow and are examined by designing a spatial database and SQL query statements. By doing so, this project found a considerable decrease in total area of green spaces in the area of study, and more general approved the analytical capabilities of spatial database design in land use change detection in urban regions.
